# ReAct Agent with OpenAI Integration

This project implements a ReAct (Reasoning and Acting) agent that interacts with an OpenAI-compatible API to perform tasks using a set of predefined tools. The agent follows a cycle of thinking, acting, observing, and reflecting to solve problems or answer questions.

## Features

- **ReAct Loop**: The agent cycles through the steps of thinking, acting, observing, and reflecting to iteratively solve problems.
- **Tool Integration**: The agent can use predefined tools such as web search, weather lookup, date retrieval, and user interaction.
- **OpenAI API Integration**: The agent communicates with an OpenAI-compatible API to generate responses and actions.
- **Streaming Responses**: The agent supports streaming responses for real-time interaction.
- **Error Handling**: The agent handles errors gracefully and can retry actions if necessary.
